Rolls-Royce is a renowned luxury automobile manufacturer with a history dating back over a century. As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, Rolls-Royce offers a range of luxurious cars that can be broadly categorized into different models, each representing the pinnacle of automotive craftsmanship, engineering, and opulence. Please note that the specific lineup may have evolved or expanded since my last update. Here's a general overview of some of the notable Rolls-Royce car categories:

Phantom Series:

The Phantom is Rolls-Royce's flagship model, representing the epitome of luxury and comfort. It is available in various configurations, including the standard Phantom, Phantom Extended Wheelbase, and the ultra-luxurious Phantom VIII. The Phantom is often chosen by those seeking the ultimate in automotive sophistication.
Ghost Series:

The Ghost is a slightly smaller and more driver-focused model than the Phantom, though it still offers an exceptional level of luxury and performance. It is designed to cater to a demographic that values both driving dynamics and a sumptuous interior.
Wraith:

The Rolls-Royce Wraith is a two-door coupe that combines the brand's trademark luxury with a sportier design and performance. It is often considered the more dynamic and driver-oriented option in the Rolls-Royce lineup.
Dawn:

The Rolls-Royce Dawn is a convertible model that shares the platform with the Wraith. It is designed to provide an open-top driving experience without compromising on the brand's commitment to luxury and craftsmanship.
Cullinan:

The Cullinan is Rolls-Royce's first-ever SUV, combining the brand's iconic luxury with off-road capabilities. It is named after the largest diamond ever discovered and aims to deliver a "high-bodied car" experience without compromising on the brand's hallmark features.
